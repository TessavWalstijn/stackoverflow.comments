### Question to broad

- Markdown
  ```markdown
  I recommend to take the stack overflow [tour](https://stackoverflow.com/tour),
  have a look around, and read through the [help center](https://stackoverflow.com/help),
  in particular [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask),
  [What types of questions should I avoid asking?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/dont-ask),
  and [What topics can I ask about here?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic).
  This question is currently far too broad and open-ended for SO's Q&A format.

### Question not minimal

 - Markdown
    ```markdown
    Can you please provide us with a minimal, reproducible example.
    Use as little code as posible that still produces the same problem.
    This includes that it is provides all parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself.
    Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem.
    For more information please read: [How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

### Question about software tools commonly used by programmers


 - Markdown
    ```markdown
    Hi I think your question might be better awnsered to the relevant company/organisation's technical support team.
    If that is the case the question might be [off-topic (read point 4)](https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic).
    However following the base on-topic points:
    - software tools commonly used by programmers; and is
    - a practical, answerable problem that is unique to software development
    It seems like your question is on-topic
